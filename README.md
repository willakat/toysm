ToySM is a small pure Python implementation of [UML2-like] [1] statemachine
semantics .

List of features supported in ToySM
-----------------------------------
* UML2 features:
  - Hierarchical states
  - enter/exit/do activities
  - Orthogonal regions (ParallelStates)
  - Transitions and Compound Transitions
  - Pseudostates
  	- InitialStates
	- FinalStates
	- TerminateStates
	- Junction
	- Shallow and Deep History states
  - Timeouts (akin to TimeEvents)

* Graphic representation

* Simple syntax to assemble States and Transition into a StateMachine

* Compatible with Python2 and Python3

* Integration with [Scapy] [2]
  - PacketTransition to use Scapy packets as transition
    trigger events.
  - SMBox for use with Scapy Pipes (requires Scapy 2.2.0-dev)


What's still missing
--------------------
* UML2
  - Choice PseudoState
  - Representation of Exit/Enter PseudoStates
  - Fork and Join PseudoStates
  - Event deferral

* Better graphing for Hierarchical states

* StateMachine Pause function

* Documentation :-)


Dependencies
------------
- [Graphviz] [3]: to produce visual representation of a StateMachine
- [xdot] [4]: direct graph rendering instead of rendering to file
- [six] [5]: Python 2/3 compatibility
